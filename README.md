# TC 2: Static Elinktricity

## Usage
Online usage: Simply navigate to ksarier.github.io
Local usage: Navigate to my ksarier.github.io folder, then open "index.html" in any browser of your choice. 

## Design Decisions
I chose to design my website based on a blog format, sorting posts chronographically (newest on top, oldest on the bottom). There is a title and a subheader at the top of every page, which also function as links back to the main landing page. Additionally, there is an "About" hyperlink included in the top right of the website to navigate the user to a page that includes a brief biography of my fictional author. From the main page, you can either click on the title of the blog post, or the blue hyperlink "READ MORE" to expand and read the full post. At the bottom of each layout are links to my author's social media sites (I linked Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). The blog draws the user's gaze to the center of the screen, where the blogs are listed. All of the whitespace on the sides also tends to draw attention to the center of the screen. Additionally, there is not much color used in my page, so whenever a piece of art is posted, its colors pop out and draw attention.

## Challenges
Similar to TC 1, I brought zero experience in html to this assignment, so it was overall a challenge to me. After trying to work locally, I realized that github pages was the most efficient option for editing a web page and publishing it publically. Setting up the pages repository with a starter kit consiting of html and css files was relatively simple, but it was hard to flush out the files that were actually useful in this assignment. It also took a long time to figure out how to implement images in the blog, from the favicon to intext images. Although the Github Pages setup was nice to use, the changes were sometimes not instantaneous, and updated faster on some pages than others (i.e. the favicon only showed on the About page for a couple of minutes before updating all around). Finally, learning different html documentations and conventions was difficult, considering all of the example code that is already online is written following those standards. I feel confident that I can now start a website in a similar fashion to what I already did, and any further enhancements could easily be found by referencing examples of html code online!

## Credits
My blog was inspired by a Github Pages and Jekyll tutorial, by Barry Clark: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/.
I included three Picasso paintings, from their respective Wikipedia pages.
